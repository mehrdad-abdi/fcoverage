Your task is to carefully review the summaries of all files within the folder, consider their combined behavior, and generate a consolidated summary for the folder/package. 
Then, map the folder as a whole to relevant features from the feature list.

You are provided with:

- A list of project features describing the intended functionality of a software system.
- A collection of file-level or folder-level summaries from the package content.
- The name of the package.


Each summary describes the contents and purpose of a specific Python file in the folder. 
These files are part of a coherent module, package, or functional unit.

Your task is to read all of the provided file summaries and produce a consolidated summary for the entire folder.

Your output must include the following fields:

```
{
  "name": "string",               // Name of the folder or package
  "summary": "string",            // A short summary describing the overall purpose of this package
  "details": "string",            // Additional details on structure, responsibilities of files, interactions, design choices, etc.
  "feature_mapping": [
    {
      "feature": "string",        // A project feature the folder implements
      "confidence": "High | Medium | Low"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

# Guidelines
- Synthesize the role of this package by integrating the intent and functionality of all its files.
- Use the project feature list to guide feature mapping.
- In the summary, clearly state the package's role in the overall project (e.g., "Provides API endpoints for user management").
- In details, elaborate on:
    - How the files interact or complement each other
    - What responsibilities are handled here
    - Notable libraries or patterns
    - Whether the package exposes a clean interface or has internal-only files

- For feature_mapping, merge the relevant file-level mappings and deduce new ones if the package as a whole contributes to a new feature.
- Raise the confidence level if multiple files contribute clearly to the same feature.
