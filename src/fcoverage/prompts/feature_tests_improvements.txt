Assess the quality of existing tests. 

Consider answering these questions:
- Are the tests readable and easy to understand?
- Are variable names clear? 
- Do they use patterns like Arrange-Act-Assert?
- Are they concise? 
- Do you see any specific refactoring improvements?

Create a list of actionable items including which tests are needed to be added and where, which tests need to updated.
