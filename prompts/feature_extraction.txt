You are given a description of a software project.
Your task is to carefully analyze the provided information and extract a **comprehensive list of features that should be covered by tests**.

While reviewing the project, consider and answer the following questions:

- What are the **primary goals** of this project?
- As a potential user, what **features would you expect** it to include?
- What other **existing projects or products** share similar goals or functionality? Use internet sources if needed to support your analysis.
- Which **features are unique differentiators** of this project compared to similar products?
- What features are **most likely to change or evolve** over time?
- What are potential **edge cases or failure scenarios** that should be tested?
- Which features would **significantly impact user experience** if they were broken or unreliable?
- For each identified feature, assign a testing priority level based on its importance to functionality and user experience: **High, Medium, or Low**.

Be **thorough, structured, and test-focused** in your analysis.
The output should include project name, description, the main goal(s), the list of features sorted by their importance.
